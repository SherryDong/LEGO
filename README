README for LEGO (0.1)

* INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We have developed a novel method named LEGO (functional Link Enrichment of Gene Ontology or gene sets). Incorporating a network-based gene-weighting scheme, LEGO measures the overlaps between the interesting genes and a given gene set by integrating both the gene weights and gene-gene interactions.   

* HOWTO COMPILE THE SOURCE AND INSTALL	
----------------------------------------------------------------------

	You will need a Unix environment with a working C++ compiler to
	compile the source files in src/. We recommened GCC>=4.2.
	Besides, Perl and R are necessary for running this program.

	Type
	$ make
	This will create a binary directory ( /bin) in the main directory.

* USAGE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the main directory, you could type:
	$ perl LEGO.pl
and you will see the help message.

The usage for this program: 

Usage: perl LEGO.pl <network file> <geneset file> <interest file> <multi or not:1-yes,0-no(e.g:0)> <bgNE,e.g:0.25> <minimun gene set size,e.g:5> <maximum gene set size,e.g:10000> <adjusted methods,e.g:fdr> <p value cutoff,e.g:0.05> 

Example1 (for single interesting gene list file): 
	perl LEGO.pl demo/FC2_human.txt demo/GeneSet_human.txt demo/input.txt 0 0.27 30 300 fdr 0.05
Example2 (for multiple interesting gene list file): 
	perl LEGO.pl demo/FC2_human.txt demo/GeneSet_human.txt demo/input_mul.txt 1 0.27 30 300 fdr 0.05

Options:
	<network file>:  the name of network file, please refer the format of demo/FC2_human.txt
	<geneset file>:  the name of geneset file, please refer the format of demo/GeneSet_human.txt
	<interest file>: the name of interesting gene list file, please refer the format of demo/input.txt
	<multi>: whether the input interesting gene list file has multiple groups, if yes, the <interest file> must be the format of demo/input_mul.txt
	<bgNE>: NE (network efficiency) for background network. 
	<minimun gene set size>: minimum gene set size
	<maximun gene set size>: maximum gene set size
	<adjusted methods>: adjusted methods for p vlaue
	<p value cutoff>: p value threshold 

Tips: 
	1. There are two output files: <interest file>_n-LEGO.final <interest file>_e-LEGO.final
	2. The first time to run this program will take about several miniutes to generate mid-files(according to the size of the network and genesets). 
	If you have already generated the mid-files for network and genesets, it will only take several seconds to calculate a new input gene list
	3. The gene ID in the network, gene set and input gene list must be the same ID system.
	4. More options are available at our online server <http://202.120.224.143:8000>. It will be available soon.
